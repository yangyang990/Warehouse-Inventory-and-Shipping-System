# Warehouse-Inventory-and-Shipping-System
You are required to build a simple warehouse system in C++ that uses a stack to manage incoming items (LIFO) and a queue to manage outgoing shipments (FIFO).
The program must allow users to add new inventory, process it into the shipping queue, and
handle shipments. Additionally, the user must be able to view the most recent item
received and the next item to ship. Ensure proper code structure, clarity, and
comments.
